**EBS Multi-Docker Deployment** and **Lambda CodeDeploy**:

### EBS Multi-Docker Deployment:
- **Elastic Beanstalk with Multi-Docker**: You can deploy multiple Docker containers in Elastic Beanstalk by using a Docker Compose file. Each container runs in its own ECS task.
  - **Dockerrun.aws.json (v2)**: This is used to define multi-container Docker applications in Elastic Beanstalk. It specifies containers, port mappings, and volumes.
  - **Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling**: Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles load balancing and scaling for your multi-container applications.
  - **Networking**: Each Docker container can be set up to communicate with other containers via networking settings in Docker Compose.
  - **Logging**: EBS supports streaming logs from Docker containers to CloudWatch.

### Lambda CodeDeploy:
- **AWS CodeDeploy with Lambda**: CodeDeploy allows you to manage updates for Lambda functions, including setting up canary and linear deployment strategies.
  - **Canary Deployment**: Gradually shift traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. You can define percentages and intervals for traffic shifts.
  - **Linear Deployment**: Similar to canary, but traffic is shifted in equal increments over time.
  - **Pre- and Post-Hooks**: These allow you to execute additional logic before and after the deployment (like validation or cleanup).
  - **Automatic Rollback**: If a specified CloudWatch alarm is triggered during deployment, CodeDeploy can automatically roll back to a previous version.
