### Notes: Launching Infrastructure for a Web Application Using Terraform

---
#### Jenkins Overview
- **What is Jenkins?**
  - Open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
  - Supports building, deploying, and automating software development processes.

#### Installation and Basic Configuration
- **Installation Steps:**
  - Download Jenkins from the official website.
  - Install using package managers (e.g., apt for Ubuntu, yum for CentOS).
  - Start Jenkins service and access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`.
  
- **Basic Configuration:**
  - Unlock Jenkins using the initial admin password found in the specified location (e.g., `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`).
  - Install suggested plugins or select specific ones.
  - Create an admin user and configure system settings.

#### Creating and Running First Job
- **Creating a Job:**
  - Select "New Item" from the dashboard.
  - Choose "Freestyle project" and name it.
  - Configure source code management (e.g., Git), build triggers, and build steps.

- **Running the Job:**
  - Save the job configuration.
  - Click "Build Now" to trigger the job.
  - Monitor the build process in the "Build History" section.

#### Adding and Managing Slaves
- **What are Slaves?**
  - Also known as agents, they allow Jenkins to distribute workloads across multiple machines.

- **Adding a Slave:**
  - Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Nodes and Clouds."
  - Select "New Node," enter the name, and configure as a "Permanent Agent."
  - Define the remote root directory, labels, and usage settings.
  
- **Managing Slaves:**
  - Monitor the status of nodes from the Jenkins dashboard.
  - Configure resource allocation and scaling based on project needs.

#### Building Triggers
- **Types of Triggers:**
  - Poll SCM: Check for changes in the source code repository at specified intervals.
  - Webhooks: Trigger builds based on events in version control systems (e.g., GitHub).

- **Setting Up Triggers:**
  - In job configuration, navigate to "Build Triggers."
  - Select desired triggers and configure parameters.

#### Continuous Integration
- **CI Practices:**
  - Regularly integrate code changes into a shared repository.
  - Automate testing and deployment processes.
  
- **Implementing CI:**
  - Configure jobs to run tests after each build.
  - Use plugins for testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).

#### Using AWS Functionality
- **Integration with AWS:**
  - Use Jenkins to deploy applications to AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3).
  - Install AWS CLI on Jenkins nodes for seamless interaction with AWS resources.

- **Configuring AWS Credentials:**
  - Store AWS access and secret keys securely in Jenkins credentials store.
  - Use these credentials in build steps to interact with AWS services.


### Self-Study: Difference Between Terraform and AWS CloudFormation
- **Terraform:**
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that is cloud-agnostic.
  - Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for configuration files.
  - Supports a wide range of providers beyond AWS.

- **AWS CloudFormation:**
  - AWS-specific IaC service that uses JSON or YAML templates.
  - Deep integration with AWS services and resources.
  - Supports stack management and rollback capabilities.

- **Key Differences:**
  - Provider Compatibility: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers; CloudFormation is limited to AWS.
  - Language: Terraform uses HCL; CloudFormation uses JSON/YAML.
  - State Management: Terraform maintains state files locally or remotely; CloudFormation manages state automatically in AWS.

### Further Reading: Using AWS Services Through Terraform
- **Getting Started with Terraform on AWS:**
  - Install Terraform and configure AWS provider.
  - Create and manage AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3) using Terraform scripts.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use modules for reusable code.
  - Manage state files using remote backends (e.g., S3).
  - Implement version control for Terraform configurations.

- **Resources:**
  - Official Terraform documentation: [Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html)
  - AWS Provider documentation: [Terraform AWS Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
  - Community tutorials and GitHub repositories for practical examples. 


### Self-Study: Difference Between Terraform and AWS CloudFormation

| Feature                | Terraform                                        | AWS CloudFormation                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider Agnostic**  | Yes, supports multiple cloud providers           | No, AWS-specific only                          |
| **Language**           | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)          | JSON/YAML                                      |
| **State Management**   | Manages state files locally or remotely          | Managed by AWS (no local state files)         |
| **Change Management**  | Plan step before apply for better visibility     | Changes are applied directly                   |
| **Modularity**         | Supports modules for reusable components         | Uses nested stacks for modularity              |
| **Community Support**  | Strong open-source community                     | Primarily AWS support                           |
| **Resource Graph**     | Builds dependency graphs for efficient updates   | Sequential deployment, less visibility         |
