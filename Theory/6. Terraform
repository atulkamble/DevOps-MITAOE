### Self-Study: Difference Between Terraform and AWS CloudFormation

| Feature                | Terraform                                        | AWS CloudFormation                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider Agnostic**  | Yes, supports multiple cloud providers           | No, AWS-specific only                          |
| **Language**           | HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)          | JSON/YAML                                      |
| **State Management**   | Manages state files locally or remotely          | Managed by AWS (no local state files)         |
| **Change Management**  | Plan step before apply for better visibility     | Changes are applied directly                   |
| **Modularity**         | Supports modules for reusable components         | Uses nested stacks for modularity              |
| **Community Support**  | Strong open-source community                     | Primarily AWS support                           |
| **Resource Graph**     | Builds dependency graphs for efficient updates   | Sequential deployment, less visibility         |
